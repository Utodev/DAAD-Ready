Files in slots 1 - 7 are not changed. This creates a single EF3 file for all slots. Later loading in this setting will not load any inserted files for slots 1 - 7.
ef3 switch to multi slot = If the EF3 emulation is started with the setting 'Slot 0 only' and switched to 'Slots 0 - 7' during the emulation, files are written in all inserted slots.

Second Button tooltip = second fire button of the Cheetah Annihilator joystick, which is only supported by a few games
Turbo Button tooltip = continuous fire, which shoots as long as you hold the button manually

Tape Noise = Tape Noise
spanish = Spanish
prioritise double mappings = Prioritization for double assignments
prioritise no input device = Input elements, which are used equally for keyboard and joysticks, can lead to problems, depending on the game. With this setting, it is up to the user alone to pay attention to it and when using a keyboard-joystick, to use keys that are not already used by the emulated keyboard, such as the numpad. However, more complex assignments can benefit from double assignments.
prioritise keyboard = Some games do not support a joystick. It is possible to use the joystick for the keyboard. However, if the joystick is also active in the Controlport, a signal is also received via it, which can lead to problems. This setting suppresses Controlport inputs, which are also in use for the keyboard. For self-created assignments for games, this setting may be unfavorable when using double assignments.
Controlport = Controlport
Turbo Direction tooltip = can be used for shaking games like "Decathlon" to fill the speed bar automatically. For most of these games, assigning a turbo button (left or right) should suffice. However, some shaking games, such as "%example%", require both buttons at once to build speed in the game. If both are used, they should be mapped to two different buttons of the controller and both buttons should then be pressed and held offset from each other for starting, as both buttons act independently of each other. For shaking games, RunAhead should be disabled.
Input sampling = Input Sampling
static sampling = static
static sampling tooltip = Once per frame, user inputs are always checked in a fixed position.
restricted dynamic sampling = restricted dynamic (JIT)
restricted dynamic sampling tooltip = At least once, a maximum of twice per frame, user inputs are checked, depending on when and how often the input is required by the software. This reduces input latency because the time interval between inspection and processing is closer together.
dynamic sampling = dynamic (JIT)
dynamic sampling tooltip = Like the setting "restricted dynamic", but unlimited input samples can be made per frame. The number of samples depends on how often the software queries inputs. In addition, a slider controls how much time must pass between 2 samples. This prevents performance degradation if software queries too frequently.
prevent dynamic sampling = prevent dynamic input sampling when runAhead is active
disable warp when input = Input check finish Warp
disable warp when input tooltip = The automatic warp is still controlled by the drive motor. However, there are games that turn off the engine very late and thus the warp runs after intermediate loading sequences, then sometimes a little too long. As a result, you have already got a hit in some games. This option also turns off the warp if the software is already checking the input.
warp first file tooltip = When activated, a connected Auto Warp only speeds up the loading of the first file. If disabled, it also accelerates reloading or intermediate loading sequences. With a few games (e.g. Scramble Infinity), but especially reloading demos, this can lead to accelerated display at inopportune moments.
eject all = eject all

select image multi = select image (multiple selection with CTRL/SHIFT)
prioritise controlport = e.g. when the cursor keys are used as a keyboard-joystick and equally move the cursor, some games cause problems. It is comparable to being operated on a joystick and keyboard at the same time. This setting suppresses keyboard inputs, which are also used for the Controlport. For self-created assignments for games, this setting may be unfavorable when using double assignments.
Kickrom = Kickstart ROM
Extrom = Extended/Encryption ROM
swap joypads Port2 = swap joypads in Port 2
apply window size = apply window size
fullscreen switch tooltip = Activation is only useful if a different resolution/refresh rate is required in fullscreen. The settings are applied only when switching from window to fullscreen. For example, a config loaded in fullscreen with a changed resolution/refresh rate will not apply it immediately, but only when switching to fullscreen the next time.
geometry = Image geometry
Expanded = Expanded
crop complete ratio = Crop complete and maintain display ratio
crop all sides equally ratio = Crop all sides equally and maintain display ratio
crop complete ratio tooltip = Since Amiga games, in contrast to C64 games, use different frame sizes, this function cannot always guarantee the ideal maximization on the screen in all games. In the fields "crop each side manually" you can alternatively create self-defined values. Some fields already contain predefined values for typical frame sizes.
toggle border prev = toggle border (prev)
autostart media = Autostart program/disk
reset free border tooltip = For the selection (7), (8), (9), resets to predefined values that are easily usable in many games.

guess media = Guessing subsequent floppy disks/tapes
guess media tooltip = The swapper can guess subsequent disks/tapes of programs if a certain naming scheme is retained for the file names. Example: "Turrican - side 1, Turrican - side 2" oder "Turrican - 1, Turrican - 2" oder "Turrican - a, Turrican - b" and so on. The subsequent files can then be inserted directly via hotkey without having to manually fill the swapper beforehand. However, if the swapper is filled manually, then the follow-up disks or tapes located in the slots are inserted.
manual ends auto warp = manual warping stops automatic warping until the next restart
Native free = Native (free)
Stereo Separation = Stereo Separation
warp first tape file tooltip = When activated, a connected Auto Warp only speeds up the loading of the first file. If disabled, it also accelerates reloading or intermediate loading sequences. For software on cassette, it is generally recommended to speed up the reload as well, as this leads to an extreme reduction in the otherwise quite long loading times. However, if you want to listen to music while loading, you must not speed up.

shader hints = To use external shaders, the file "shaders_slang.zip" is required. After this has been unzipped, the shaders are available. If RetroArch is already installed, then the shaders can be updated automatically via the RetroArch interface and are usually located in a subfolder of RetroArch. It is important that only the folder "shaders_slang" is required or accepted. This also applies if you use OpenGL as a driver.
