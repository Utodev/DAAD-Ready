GENERADOR DE CARACTERES DE SINTAC PARA DAAD
===========================================

This is a version of SINTAC character editor, that has now support to load DAAD fonts.

You can savbe DAAD 16 bit and DAAD 8 bit. 

As the tool is in Spanish, and although I think menus are easy to understand, here they go some translations

Fichero -> File
Cargar fuente -> Load font
Grabar fuente -> Save font
Salir -> Exit
Editar -> Edit
Fuente -> font
Probar -> Try/Test
Efectos -> Effects
Invertir -> Invert
Rayado -> scanlines
Cursiva -> Italic
Izquierda -> Left
Derecha -> Right
Negrita -> Bold

Also:

- When you modify a character you have to press the "<-A" button in order to save changes to the left table (to save to disk use menus).
- If you click on any character in the table, then in the small representation of the character in between the table and the edit area (just over the aSCII code), then again on the table, you copy it.
