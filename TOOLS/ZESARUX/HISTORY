A brief description about how this started...

In 1996 I started my first Spectrum emulator, the ZXSpectr (https://github.com/chernandezba/zxspectr)
It was written entirely on Assembler for PC x86.

While I was working on ZXSpectr, I thought many times on porting ZXSpectr to GNU/Linux. 
I was (and I am still) a big fan of GNU/Linux and I wanted my emulator to run on it. 
But I didn't have the knowledge of some developing facts on Unix, like XWindows.

One day, on September 2013, I uploaded a new version of ZXSpectr; it was not a big release, only some minor fixes. 
I thought then on some kind of conversion routine to dump the text that can be found on a Spectrum screen file (SCR).
It started as a filter to my file converter: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fconverter/
With this filter, you could read a SCR file and if it had normal ASCII Spectrum texts it would dump them to the output file.

Then I thought that filter could be the routine to refresh the Spectrum screen on an emulator...

From that moment, I started to make this new emulator, ZEsarUX, starting from zero. 
I ported the filter to use a ncurses driver on Unix, and began emulating the whole Z80 CPU.

ZEsarUX is not a port of ZXSpectr; ZEsarUX is a new emulator. Obviously, I used all my knowledge I got from ZXSpectr to this new emulator.

And the rest is history....
