ZEsarUX supports both native Windows execution (using mingw) or Cygwin.
Minimum Windows version to run ZEsarUX is Windows XP
Mingw is a minimal GNU environment system for Windows, and Cygwin is a more complete GNU system, including X-Windows.
I recommend you to use mingw. I will describe both:



-- Native Windows (with mingw)

If you have downloaded the Windows binary version, you don't need to install ZEsarUX. It can be run with the executable file:

zesarux.exe


If you are using the source code and want to compile it:

-First install mingw:

On mingw installation program, go to Basic Setup and select:
mingw-developer-toolkit
mingw32-base
mingw32-gcc-g++
msys-base
mingw-pthreads (all packages that apply)
msys-bash

-Download SDL 1.2 library, from https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php,
and get SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz (Mingw32). 

SDL2 is supported, but doesn't work well, so I recommend to use SDL 1.2

Unzip and copy all contents to c:\mingw\sdl\
(or c:\mingw\sdl2\)

So on c:\mingw\sdl\lib you have some libSDL.dll* files, and
on c:\mingw\sdl\include\ you have subfolder SDL and inside some .h files


(
-Optional:
You can install SSL library, to have a full speccy download browser (without ssl you'll have partial browser):
Install prebuilds from
https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries
https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/openssl
https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/download_file?file_path=openssl-1.1.1d-win32-mingw.zip



Uncompress it and copy to the include and lib folders of Mingw, in my example:
c:\openssl-1.1.1d-win32-mingw\include
c:\openssl-1.1.1d-win32-mingw\lib

And copy libcrypto-1_1.dll y libssl-1_1.dll to the folder you downloaded ZEsarUX

You will have to set the following environment variables before run configure command:

export CFLAGS "-I/c/openssl-1.1.1d-win32-mingw/include"
export LDFLAGS "-L/c/openssl-1.1.1d-win32-mingw/lib"

and add setting --enable-ssl to the configure command
)



-Run Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

#set PATH to the gcc and make mingw binaries:
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin;c:\mingw\msys\1.0\bin

#go to the ZEsarUX downloaded source code
cd <where it is located>


run bash

./configure --enable-memptr --enable-visualmem --enable-cpustats

Or using sdl2:

./configure --enable-memptr --enable-visualmem --enable-cpustats --enable-sdl2


Note: sometimes the configure script on Windows stops with an error like:
"./configure.compile.c.o: No such file or directory"
or
"rm: cannot lstat './configure.compile.c.o': Permission denied"

Seems to be some kind of issue with Windows and bash.... don't worry, just run the command again and it will now finish without errors



Then:
make



#copy SDL.dll to the current directory
copy c:\mingw\sdl\bin\SDL.dll .
or for sdl2:
copy c:\mingw\sdl2\bin\SDL2.dll .


#And run ZEsarUX

zesarux.exe


It doesn't need to be installed anywhere, it can be run from here, or move the whole directory to wherever you want

-----------------------------------------------

-- Cygwin

Cygwin version must be configured by yourself, as you have to install cygwin and use an xterminal:
Install cygwin with developer tools
Open All programs/Cygwin X/X Win Server. This will launch the X server with an xterminal
cd /cygdrive/c/... where the ZEsarUX source code is located
./configure 
make

You will have a compiled zesarux.exe

Now you can run it inside this xterminal with:

./zesarux.exe

Note: it seems the xwindows driver does not work with cygwin. Instead you can use the sdl driver:

./zesarux.exe --vo sdl


Every time you want to launch the emulator you must launch the X server and run the emulator inside the xterminal

If you run the emulator inside a "Cygwin Terminal", you must remember to have the X server running and export DISPLAY inside the terminal:

export DISPLAY=:0.0



About audio support... in my pc the sdl audio driver does not work, but the dsp driver does, so, run it with:

./zesarux.exe --vo sdl --ao dsp


* Running on a normal windows command line console (cmd.exe):

Note: I do not know how to run the emulator with xwindows or sdl driver inside a normal windows command line console (cmd.exe).
It needs a lot of cyg*.dll in the same path of the emulator (that you can copy from c:\cygwin\bin) but it does not find the Xserver.
But you can run the emulator with another video driver, like stdout:

zesarux.exe --vo stdout
