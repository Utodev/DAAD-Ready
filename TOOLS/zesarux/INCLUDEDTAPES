In my_soft/ folder you can find some software for the emulated machines.

They are programs and games made by myself or my family. Many of them are simple programs written in basic, that I made when I was a child, and some other are more complex programs, like the SPED compiler, RealDebug debugger, or Cursor Draw drawing program. Some of these programs have documentation found on file my_soft/info_my_soft.odt. 

Some of these programs made by me are published as brand "Man Software". 
Software made by my father and my oldest brother are published as "Micro bit" or "Micro Byt". 
Software made by my middle brother are published as "Bit Soft"

Note: some of my simple games, made in basic, have kempston joystick support. They were programmed on Inves Spectrum + and kempston joystick reading only works on Inves and not on other Spectrum machines.

You can also download the extras package, from the repository:

https://github.com/chernandezba/zesarux-extras

Also included in the ZEsarUX-extras package of the last distribution. 

There you can find some tapes, snapshots, cartridges and EPROM cards for the emulated machines.
I included them for different reasons:

- They are important programs or games for a machine, like Mazogs on ZX81

- They make some hi-res and special effects, like Overscan on Spectrum or Manic miner on ZX81

- They are programs to test the behaviour on the emulator
