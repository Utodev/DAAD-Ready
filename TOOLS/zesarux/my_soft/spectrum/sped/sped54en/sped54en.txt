This is sped54en, with the save object code bug from sped52 fixed, and with the English translation made by Tim Gilberts

The sources are in just plain text files, not on sped file format, so you can compile with your favorite cross assembler
Also, 8-bit registers from IX have the sped syntax (LX, HX) which are compatible with sjasmplus syntax.
On Pasmo, they are called IXL, IXY

You may compile with pasmo with:

sjasmplus sped54en.asm sped54en_paging.asm

The binary output file will be: sped.bin
