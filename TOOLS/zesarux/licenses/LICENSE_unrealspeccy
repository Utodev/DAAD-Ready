license

        UnrealSpeccy is completely freeware. You may use this emulator
        and its sources without any restrictions. You may use the
        sources in your own emul or to release bugfixed/new versions.
        in this case you do not have to release updated source code,
        (unlike GNU Public License requires, for example). You may port
        emulator to any other platform (but there are many
        MSVC-specific language constructions, so it's doubtful that
        you can compile it with another compiler)
