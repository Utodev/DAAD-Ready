David Hernández Bañó
21/04/1975 - 03/11/2023

David passed away at the young age of 48, after fighting cancer for 2 years.

I wrote the preceding lines shortly after my brother David died and for a long time I was not able to write anything else.
The pain and grief of losing him marked the following weeks.
On the day of writing this, 3 months after his death, I am able to write what my brother David meant.
David was an excellent brother, a great person and a great father and husband.
I could tell many things about him, and it wouldn't end. But I will focus on perhaps the most memorable part, our common childhood.

We are three brothers: Oscar, the oldest, David, 4 years younger, and I, César, 2 years younger than David.
David and I grew up sharing a room and many hobbies in common.
He was very intelligent, somewhat quiet and funny. We enjoyed burning ants with a magnifying glass, making mazes in the room using cassette tapes or experimenting with homemade radio transmitter that my father built.

Another of those hobbies was computers, and for a while, we both had an Inves Spectrum+ each.
With that computer we experienced all its "differences" and what made it different from a normal ZX Spectrum.
We both discovered and were able to understand why the things that happened with that computer happened. It was an exciting  time.
Years later, when I started with ZEsarUX, David always gave me very good suggestions to improve it.
And he was even the one who suggested that I adapt the code to be able to run it on Haiku OS; so if you are a user of said operating system and use ZEsarUX in it, you owe it to my brother David.

Although I will never fully accept that he is no longer with us, I have to move on, no matter what, and always remember it, to have him alive in my memories, even though there are a lot of things that I can no longer do, because doing them meant share it with David.

Rest in peace brother. I love you.
