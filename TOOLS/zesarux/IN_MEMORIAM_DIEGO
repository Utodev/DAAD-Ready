My father instilled in my two brothers and me a passion for computing.
He was a self-taught person with extensive knowledge of electronics and engineering.
When people began to talk about home computers in Spain at the beginning of the 80s, he saw that those machines would have a very important role in the future, and he wanted both him and us, his children, to learn to use them to, probably, dedicate ourselves professionally to the world of computing.
Thus, when I was 4 years old, around 1981, we already had a Sinclair ZX81 at home, with which, as my mother says, I learned to add and multiply before starting school.
Later came a Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k, then the Sinclair QL, and years later, a pair of Inves Spectrum+.

My father didn't get to know ZEsarUX, but he did get to know my first emulator, ZXSpectr.
I'm sure that if he had known ZEsarUX, he would have loved it and would have made lots of suggestions and corrections, as he always used to do with my programs.
So even though he did not coincide in time with this emulator, there is a lot of him in ZEsarUX, just as logically there is a lot of him in me.

He was a great person and a good father.

Rest in peace.
