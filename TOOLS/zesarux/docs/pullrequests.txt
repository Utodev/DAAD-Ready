Hi. 
I’ve decided I’m not accepting pull requests to ZEsarUX anymore.
I’ve been thinking it a lot and I can’t handle it. You have to think I’m the only maintainer of this software, I spend a lot of time working on ZEsarUX and I can’t spend more time reviewing pull requests and accepting them.

Of course I will accept requests and suggestions to add, and ZEsarUX will always be open source and free (gratis).

I hope you understand it, if I were a company mantaining a software or a team of coders, that situation would be different. But that’s not the case. Maybe in the future, if I had more spare time, I could change my mind.
