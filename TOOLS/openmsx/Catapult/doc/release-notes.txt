Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.15.0 (2018-12-05)
======================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.15.0.

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Disable controls for joystick/printer port if the machine doesn't have them
- Fix Catapult trashing the replay at time 0 (when reversing back to time 0)
- Added .hdd extension when browsing for harddisk images
- The test machine for extensions is now C-BIOS_MSX2+ (if available)

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly. Use the spacebar to
  deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert
  to the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)
