
DAAD Ready A ??/??/2025
=======================

DAAD Ready comes with major changes, although most of them are internal and not visible for users:

- Documentation: documentation has been separated into basic and multimedia documentation.
                 Multimedia documentation includes basic and advanced graphics, audio and 
                 animations/video information.

- ATARIST: DAAD Ready can now play SFX sounds by adding WAV files to SOUNDS folder, using the classic PICTURE/SFX approach. 
           It's explained in the new multimedia manual.

- AMIGA: DAAD Ready can now play SFX sounds by adding WAV files to SOUNDS folder, using the classic PICTURE/SFX approach.
         It's explained in the new multimedia manual.

- MSDOS: support for OPL2 music and 8 bit mono sound samples vía SFX condact straight ahead (without
         using PICTURE first). It also supports the old PICTURE/SFX combination for samples though.
         Interpreter supports now floating images and partial palette updates. Also support for FLI 
         animations -via SFX condact- added. WHATO condAct was failing when using adjectives, fixed.
         Finally, support for MOUSE condact added.

- HTML: interpreter supports now floating images and partial palette updates. Also supports MP3 music
        and MP3 sound samples via SFX condact straight ahead (without using PICTURE first), but also
        via the old PICTURE/SFX combination for samples. It also supports MP4 animations via SFX 
        condact. Finally, support for BEEP and MOUSE condacts added.

- Spectrum Next: new fully native interpreter based on original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY
                 in the 16 bit interpreters style (with floating images and limited palette updates), plus 
                 BEEP support, plus some built in Maluva condacts as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This interpreter
                 does not support drawstring graphics anymore, and all the new features are available 
                 without taking the almost 2 Kb of extra space that the Maluva extension took. Also fixes bug
                 when interpreter was not properly updating flag 63 when WINDOW was called.                 

- ZX Spectrum +3: new fully native interpreter based on original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY
                  in the 16 bits interpreters style (with floating images and pre-buffered images), plus
                  BEEP support, plus some built  in Maluva condacts as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This interpreter does
                  not support drawstring graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking
                  the almost 2 Kb of extra space that the Maluva extension took. Also fixes bug when interpreter
                  was not properly updating flag 63 when WINDOW was called.

- ZX Spectrum 128K (tape): new  full native interpreter based on original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY
                           in the 16 bits interpreters style(with floating images), plus BEEP support, plus some 
                           built in Maluva condacts as XMESSAGE or XUNDONE. This interpreter does not support 
                           drawstring graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking
                           the almost 2 Kb of extra space that the Maluva extension took. Also fixes bug when
                           interpreter was not properly updating flag 63 when WINDOW was called.

          bits interpreters style (with floating images  plus limited palette updates), plus BEEP support, 
          plus some built Maluva condacts as XMESSAGE or XUNDONE. This interpreter does not support drawstrings
          graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking the almost 2 kilobytes of 
          extra space that the Maluva extension took. Also fixes bug when interpreter was not properly updating 
          flag 63 when WINDOW was called.

- ZX-ESXDOS: new full native interpreter based in original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY in the

             as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This interpreter does not support drawstrings graphics anymore, and all the new
             features are available without taking the almost 2 kilobytes of extra space that the Maluva extension
             took. Also fixes bug when interpreter was not properly updating flag 63 when WINDOW was called.

- MSX1: new interpreter with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY, but not full (only fixed top image as with old Maluva 
        extension is possible). The PICTURE/DISPLAY feature replaces the old drawstrings graphics, so almost 2Kb
        of RAM are available. Also fixed a bug when interpreter was not properly updating flag 63 when WINDOW

        it if they want to use it.Also, CPC games can now run from drive B". Also, fixed a bug that prevented users
        with AZERTY keyboard to type the m/M characters. To avoid it, the enia (ñ) character has been moved to the key 
        with the + symbol instead the of the star key. You still can type the enia character using CTRL+N, that hasn't 
        changed. Finally, BEEP condact implemented. 

-C64: new interpreter with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY, but not full (only fixed top image as with old Maluva 
      extension is possible). The PICTURE/DISPLAY feature replaces the old drawstrings graphics, so almost 2Kb

      was called. Also, Maluva condacts XMESSAGE and XUNDONE are supported. Finally, split screen mode is not the default 
      mode anymore. Authors have to activate it if the want to use it.

       embedded support for XMESSAGE and XUNDONE. Also fixed a bug when interpreter was not properly updating 
       flag 63 when WINDOW was called. Also fixed a bug with WINAT in the English interpreter.

  image will be located at RELEASE\AMIGA\FLOPPY, although the testing will be done with
