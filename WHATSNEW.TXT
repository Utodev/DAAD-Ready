===========================

- Documentation: separated documentation with standard documentation and multimedia documentation. Also multimedia documentation includes basic and advance graphcis information.
- MSDOS: support for OPL2 music and 8 bit mono sound effects v√≠a SFX condact.
- MSDOS: interpreter supports now floating images and partial palette updates.
- MSDOS: support of FLI animations via SFX condact.
- HTML: interpreter supports now floating images and partial palette updates.
- HTML: support for MP3 music and MP3 sound effects via SFX condact.
- OLDMSDOS: old MSDOS target has been removed.
- Spectrum Next: new interpreter not using Maluva extension. Instead, fully native interpreter based in original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY 
                 in the 16 bits interpreters style (with floating images and limited palette updates), plus BEEP support, plus some built Maluva condacts 
                 as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This interpreter does not support drawstrings graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking
                 the almost 2 kilobytes of extra space that the Maluva extension took.
- Spectrum +3: new interpreter not using Maluva extension. Instead, fully native interpreter based in original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY 
                 in the 16 bits interpreters style (with floating images and pre-buffered images), plus BEEP support, plus some built Maluva condacts 
                 as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This interpreter does not support drawstrings graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking
                 the almost 2 kilobytes of extra space that the Maluva extension took. This interpreter replaces the previously used ZXDAAD128 for the +3 target.
- ZX-Uno: new interpreter not using Maluva extension. Instead, fully native interpreter based in original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY 
                 in the 16 bits interpreters style (with floating images plus limited palette updates), plus BEEP support, plus some built Maluva condacts 
                 as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This interpreter does not support drawstrings graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking
                 the almost 2 kilobytes of extra space that the Maluva extension took.               
- ZX-ESXDOS: new interpreter not using Maluva extension. Instead, fully native interpreter based in original DAAD code, with support of PICTURE/DISPLAY 
                 in the 16 bits interpreters style (with floating images), plus BEEP support, plus some built Maluva condacts as XMESSAGE o XUNDONE. This 
                 interpreter does not support drawstrings graphics anymore, and all the new features are available without taking  the almost 2 kilobytes 
                 of extra space that the Maluva extension took.                   
- MSX1: new interpreter with  Maluva extensione embedded, instead of using the eextension. The embedded features replace the drawstrings graphics support, so 
        it saves about 2 kilobytes of space. 
- CPC: new interpreter with  Maluva extensione embedded, instead of using the eextension. The embedded features replace the drawstrings graphics support, so 
       it saves about 2 kilobytes of space. 
- CPC: Fixed a bug with WINAT in the English interpreter.
- PCW: interpreter patched to be the 1-part interpreter instead of the 2-part interpreter.       
- Fonts: Some changed made in default fonts so the upper font looks different from the lower one.
- Several interpreters (but not all): Now all ZX targets, CPC and MSX1 properly update flag 63 when WINDOW is called.
- DRC: compilar changed to allow many of the new features the new new original interpreters support.
- DAAD Ready can now play SFX sounds by adding WAV files to SOUNDS folder, in the Amiga, Atari ST and Windos(experimental) targets



  
  

DAAD Ready 0.9.3 27/03/2024
===========================

- Spectrum Next: New interpreter. Embeds Maluva features such as XPICTURE/XMESSAGE/XUNDONE/XSPEED. 
  Also, fixes the issues we had with END/EXIT not erasing last picture on game exit, and restores 
  normal speed on EXIT. As counterpart, it does not include drawstrings (vector) graphics support.
  This interpreter has about 2 more kilobytes available for the DDB. The old Spectrum Next intrepreter
  is still available under the OLDZXNEXT.BAT file, in case you need drawstring. Also, the
  compiler has been updated for Spectrum Next new interpreter.

- HTML: jDAAD More... feature has been improved, again.

         of locno+ in several condacts. Fixed weight and height in PCX load.  Fixed bug with article
         replacing in English.

- ZX128PLUS3 and ZX128TAPE: Fixed bug with XPICTURE that was drawing a black band. Last convertible noun is now #39 
  instead of #19

- ATARIST: now a proper .ST floppy disk image is created with your game. The floppy disk
  image will be located at RELEASE\ATARIST\FLOPPY, although the testing will be done with
  the separated files at RELEASE\ATARIST as is faster to test with them.
- AMIGA: now a proper .ADF floppy disk image is created with your game. The floppy disk
  image will be located at RELEASE\AMIGA\FLOPPY, although the testing will be done with
  the separated files at RELEASE\AMIGA as is faster to test with them.
- MSDOS, HTML, ZX128TAPE and ZX128PLUS3: Fixed bug with '@' being replaced in English games

  the text forcing "More..." to happen
- Compiler: processes can now appear in any order and process list can have gaps. Also the same
  process can appear more than one (if so, those with some number are just merged together as 
  if they were parts of a single process)

  the image, saving RAM.
