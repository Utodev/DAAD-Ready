=======================

Documentation
-------------
Documentation has been separated into basic and multimedia documentation.  Multimedia documentation
includes basic and advanced graphics, audio and animations/video information.

Multimedia
----------
- DAAD Ready can now add SFX sounds by adding 8 bit mono WAV files to SOUNDS folder, using the classic 
  PICTURE/SFX approach, in the Amiga, PC/DOS and Atari ST targets. The HTML interpreter can do the same
  with MP3 files.
- You can also add DRO files to SOUNDS folder to play OPL music in the background in the PC/DOS target. 
  The PC/DOS target can play music and sound effects at the same time,and has extended ways to play the
  SFX sounds, aside of the original  PICTURE/SFX approach (i.e. repeat, loop). The HTML interpreter can
  do the same with MP3 files.
- The PC/DOS interpreter now supports floating/fixed images and partial palette loading. It also supports
  FLI 320x200 animations and MOUSE condact.
- The HTML interpreter now supports floating/fixed images. It also supports MP4 animations and both BEEP
  and MOUSE condact.
- Spectrum Next and ZX-Uno interpreters don't use XPICTURE anymore, and now use original PICTURE/DISPLAY
  approach. They also supports floating/fixed images and partial palette loading.
- Spectrum +3, Spectrum 128K, Spectrum ESXDOS also use PICTURE/DISPLAY now, and support floating/fixed
  images. Spectrum +3 also support buffered images (the others don't really need it).
- Amstrad CPC, C64, Plus/4 and MSX1 interpreters now use PICTURE/DISPLAY also, but only support Maluva 
  style fixed images (top image) and neither support floating images nor buffered images.
- CPC interpreter does now support BEEP.
- Split screen modes in CPC and C64 are not default modes anymore. Users have to activate them if they
  want to use them. 
- Some changes have been made in default fonts so the upper font looks different from the lower one. 
  Also, look of the character "รง" has been improved.

Other features
--------------
- CPC games can now run from drive B.
- In the new interpreters, based in original source code, some of the remaining "Maluva condacts" have been
  implemented internally:
    + XMESSAGE: implemented in all targets that used Maluva before.
    + XUNDONE: implemented in all targets that used Maluva before.
    + XSPLITSCR: implemented in all targets that used split screen before (C64 and CPC).
    + XPART: has been removed because of lack of use.
    + XSPEED: has been removed, although the targets that used it before (Spectrum Next and ZX-Uno) control 
      the speed internally, so it's not required anymore.
- PCW interpreter does also include XMESSAGE and XUNDONE support. It also doesn't shown the "part" selection
  screen anymore.       
- Targets not supporting XMESSAGES (Amiga, AtariST and Spectrum 48K) use the -force-normal-messages parameter
  to DRC, so the game will not use XMESSAGES but the normal messages system. Authors can now work with XMESSAGES
  if needed while not needing  to add #ifdef for some targets

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed WHATO condAct in the PC/DOS interpreter. It was not working fine when using adjectives.
- Fixed a bug where flag 63 was not being updated in many interpreters when WINDOW was called.
- Fixed a bug in the CPC and PCW English interpreters that were not allowing the WINAT condact to work  properly.
- Fixed a bug where the CPC interpreter was usign a key for the "ร" character, which overlapped the "N" key in 
  AZERTY keyboards. It uses now the one just right of that one, to avoid overlapping.

Important changes in interpreters
---------------------------------
- All Spectrum targets but the 48K one, C64, Plus4, CPC and MSX1 don't support vectorial graphics anymore. This 
  means the almost 2K of RAM used by the Maluva extension before are now available for the game, as the new 
  interpreters replace the vectorial graphics with the PICTURE/DISPLAY approach.
- The old MSDOS target has been definitively removed.
- ZXDAAD128 has been replaced as main interpreter for the Spectrum 128K and +3 targets. Now, a new interpreter 
  based in the original source codeis used. ZXDAAD128 remains though in the experimental targets.

Quick notes about Spectrum 128K tape version
---------------------------------------------
- The new 128K tape interpreter stores XMESSAGEs and IMAGES in the upper pages of the Spectrum 128K RAM. The rest
  remains in the same place as the old 48K interpreter. This means that there may be free RAM available, but still 
  the game not fitting. If you run out of 'lower' RAM, you can replace some MESSAGE/MES with XMESSAGE/MES, so the
  text of those message will be stored in the upper pages. 

- The image compression takes a while, so the ZX128K.BAT file doesn't create all the images every time. If you want
  to process again some image, you will have to delete the files with extension .zx0 and .128 from the IMAGES. That
  will force compression of those images again. Also, if you want to delete an image, you will have to delete the .scr
  file, but also the .zx0 and .128 files.

-  In upper RAM, XMESSAGES fill the pages first, then the images are placed in the remaining space using a "bigger than
  fits first" algorythm. Images will compress better if they are simpler (the more blank space the better). Also, it will 
  compress better if there are repeated patterns in the image. If you run out of space try to make them simpler. Also,
  you can try to use the same image in different locations.

- The experimental 128K interpreter has differente approaches for the way the RAM is handled, so you may try to use it
  as well. Have in mind though it's experimental, and bugs may appear. 


DAAD Ready 0.9.3 27/03/2024
===========================

- Spectrum Next: New interpreter. Embbeds Maluva features such as XPICTURE/XMESSAGE/XUNDONE/XSPEED. 
  Also, fixes the issues we had with END/EXIT not erasing last picture on game exit, and restores 
  normal speed on EXIT. As counterpart, it does not include drawstrings (vector) graphics support.
  This interpreter has about 2 more kilobytes available for the DDB. The old Spectrum Next intrepreter
  is still available under the OLDZXNEXT.BAT file, in case you need drawstring. Also, the
  compiler has been updated for Spectrum Next new interpreter.

- HTML: jDAAD More... feature has been improved, again. 

- MSDOS: Fixed bug with END condact. Last convertible noun is now #39 instead of #19. Fixed support 
         of locno+ in several condacts. Fixed weight and height in PCX load.  Fixed bug with article
         replacing in English.

- ZX128PLUS3 and ZX128TAPE: Fixed bug with XPICTURE that was drawing a black band. Last convertible noun is now #39 
  instead of #19

- Compiler: New symbols NUM_CARRIED and NUM_WORN added, to allow the programmer to automatically know how many objects are carried or worn when the game starts.

DAAD Ready 0.9.2 01/01/2024
===========================
- MSDOS: Fixed bug with MODE condact and character selection
- HTML : Fixed bug with MODE condact and character selection
- ATARIST: now a proper .ST floppy disk image is created with your game. The floppy disk
  image will be located at RELEASE\ATARIST\FLOPPY, although the testing will be done with
  the separated files at RELEASE\ATARIST as is faster to test with them.
- AMIGA: now a proper .ADF floppy disk image is created with your game. The floppy disk
  image will be located at RELEASE\AMIGA\FLOPPY, although the testing will be done with
  the separated files at RELEASE\AMIGA as is faster to test with them.
- MSDOS, HTML, ZX128TAPE and ZX128PLUS3: Fixed bug with '@' being replaced in English games
- ZX128TAPE and ZX128PLUS3: Fixed bug with with TAKEOUT, as flags were not being updated

- DRC: the compiler accepts processes in any order now.
- Start databases: start DSF files for all 5 languages have been updated for easy readability
- HTML: fixed another bug with "More..." feature that was happening when the input prompt was
  the text forcing "More..." to happen
- Compiler: processes can now appear in any order and process list can have gaps. Also the same
  process can appear more than one (if so, those with some number are just merged together as 
  if they were parts of a single process)
  
DAAD Ready 0.9.1 28/10/2023
===========================

- jDAAD (HTML): fixed bug that made virtual keyboard keys' text selectable
- ZX128TAPE and ZX128PLUS3 can now include images which use only their 96 first lines, just like
  other Maluva targets do. These targets can now also save space by making mirrored images (images
  where right half is an exact mirror of left half). The system will detect it and save just half
  the image, saving RAM.
- ZX128TAPE and ZX128PLUS3: fixed bug with Spanish pronoun sufixes
